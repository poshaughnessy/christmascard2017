# Christmas Card 2017

Every year, I make a web app as a kind of digital Christmas 'card' for my colleagues. This one is an ARCore demo that lets you place a snowman on a surface around you. 

It's not really finished off though - I wanted to add a snow effect and add the ability to interact with the snowman, but neither are currently working.
